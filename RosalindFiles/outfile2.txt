  Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
When you're chewing on life's gristle, don't grumble give a whistle
"Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
Always look on the right side of life
  The frumious Bandersnatch!"
When you're feeling in the dumps, don't be silly, chumps
So rested he by the Tumtum tree,
Just before you draw your terminal breath
  The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
You see, it's all a show, keep them laughing as you go
One, two! One, two! And through and through
And always look on the right side of life
  He went galumphing back.
